I fell in love with the game, and it is now my most played game on Steam (by a lot). I started hosting servers in 2020 around the time the COVID-19 pandemic began. Since then, I have spent hundreds (if not thousands) of hours developing DayZ servers, mods, and other content. I hope you enjoy the servers - join us in helping to keep this great game alive!"
